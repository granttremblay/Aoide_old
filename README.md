Aoide is a suite of Python tools for [MUSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html),
an optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope.
Initially, this repository will be a haphazard mess of random python codes, though
I hope to eventually organize this into a suite of well-documented tools suitable
for the general public.
