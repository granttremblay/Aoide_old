### Grant R. Tremblay (Yale University)
Analysis suite for ESO's Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, MUSE



Aoide is a suite of Python tools for [MUSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html),
a one by one arcminute FoV Integral Field Unit spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope.

Initially a dump for our random MUSE codes, I hope to eventually clean this
up into a working suite of tools.
